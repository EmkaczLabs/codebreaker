# Codebreaker

A small Fabric client-side mod that detects contest verification codes announced on a server and helps (optionally) send them back to the server.

- Target server network: craftplay.pl
- Intended use: Educational purposes only (testing / learning). Not to be used for cheating or malicious behavior on public servers.

## Summary

Codebreaker listens for chat and server/game messages and attempts to extract verification codes announced during contests. It shows a client-side prompt and provides a client-only command to send the detected code to the server.

## Features

- Detects codes in both player chat and server/game announcement messages.
- Client command `/ck` sends the detected code (client-side). Use `/ck cancel` to clear the pending code.
- New subcommand `/ck cooldown` shows the current send cooldown; use `/ck cooldown <seconds>` to change it at runtime.
- Heuristics tuned for announcement formats like:
  `Konkurs » Osoba ktora przepisze najszybciej kod: 123456789... uzywajac: /kod (kod)`
- Debugging mode prints helpful logs to the dev-run console to aid regex tuning.
- Default safety: automatic sending is disabled (AUTO_SEND = false). For contest announcements the mod will detect and (optionally) auto-send conservatively; a resend guard prevents duplicate quick sends.

## Build

This project uses Gradle and Fabric Loom. From the project root run (cmd.exe / PowerShell):

```bash
gradle build
```

To start a dev client from the project (recommended for testing):

```bash
gradle runClient
```

## Usage / Testing (developer/dev-run)

1. Start a Fabric dev client (`gradle runClient`) or run the built mod in a client with Fabric.
2. Join `craftplay.pl` (or a test server with similar contest messages).
3. When an announcement appears that matches the expected format you should see client messages:
   - `[Codebreaker] Detected code: <code>. Type /ck to send.` (requires you to run `/ck` to confirm), or
   - `[Codebreaker] Detected code (game msg): <code> — auto-sending` and the code will be sent automatically for contest-style announcements.
4. To manually send a pending code, type `/ck` in chat. To cancel a pending code use `/ck cancel`.
5. To view or change the cooldown at runtime use `/ck cooldown` or `/ck cooldown <seconds>`.

## Configuration and flags

- `AUTO_SEND` (boolean, default `false`) — if `true` the mod sends detected codes automatically; default is `false` for safety.
- `DEBUG_CONSOLE` (boolean, default `true`) — if `true` the dev-run console receives logs about incoming messages and which extraction branch matched.
- `SEND_COOLDOWN_MS` (default `5000`) — cooldown between sending the same code (ms). Change at runtime with `/ck cooldown <seconds>` or programmatically with `setSendCooldownMillis(long ms)`.

## Debugging / Tuning

- The code detection lives in `src/client/java/pl/emkacz/codebreaker/client/CodebreakerClient.java`.
- If detection fails, enable `DEBUG_CONSOLE`, reproduce the announcement, and copy the console output + any in-chat `[Codebreaker][DEBUG] Raw message: ...` lines into an issue so the regex can be tuned.
- The extractor prefers digits after `kod` or immediately before `uzywaj`, otherwise it picks the longest standalone digit group while avoiding digits embedded in letters.

## Safety & Server Rules

This tool is intended for educational use (learning Fabric modding, practicing message parsing). Do not use it to gain unfair advantage or to violate server rules. Respect server TOS and community rules on `craftplay.pl` and any other server.

## Contributing

If you want the regex tuned, a different notification method, or extra features (logging to file, localization, persistence of settings), open an issue or send a PR. Include sample announcement strings for validation.
